## HTTP Server: Java
This Java HTTP 1.1 server implementation uses the HttpExchange library to simulate the HTTP 1.1 protocol.
The server covers methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. Accessible files are example.txt, index.html,
and '/', which redirects to a defaulted response. Other files include cats/{error-code}.jpg, which are used as responses
when certain logic is called within the server implementation. Feel free to add files with PUT, or add text to example.txt using POST, but try not to delete any of the important files!
